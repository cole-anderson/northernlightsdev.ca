                WSL has been the most revolutionary tool in my arsenal as while I am an avid
                fan of the linux desktop enviroment(Ubuntu and Manjaro) I also enjoy being able
                to do all my work and play on a single operating system. VSCode is my editor of choice
                but I have previously used the likes of Visual Studio, Eclipse, Atom and Emacs and
                totally un-related to my day to day programming I am also highly proficient
                in Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premier Pro from over 10 years editing a
                variety of videos both in the gaming and film spaces.
