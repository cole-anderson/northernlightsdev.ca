            <p>
                I have primarily programmed through my degree in C++ and Java with exposure
                to languages such as Racket, Processing and Verilog to name a few. I also have
                recently been developing in Python(using Flask) and Javascript(using React)
                in order to build both this portfolio as well as my current passion project
                "AniLog" which you can see here (put link here)
            </p>
        </div>
