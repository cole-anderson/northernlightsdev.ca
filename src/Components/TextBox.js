            <p>
                I have primarily programming through my degree in C++ and Java with exposure
                to languages such as Racket, Processing and Verilog to name a few. I also have
                recently been developing using Python(using Flask) and Javascript(using React)
                in order to build both this portfolio as well as my current passion project
                "AniLog" which you can see here "link here"
            </p>
        </div>
